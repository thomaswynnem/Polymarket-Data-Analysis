# Polymarket-Data-Analysis

This is a copy of the silver edition code for the data analysis I am doing with Dr. Andrey Kuehlkamp on Polymarket. This preview of the actual repository, analyzes properties of all smart contracts that include the following:

* The total amount of spending in each category (Sports, Politics, Science, etc)
* The total amount of spending in each market, including an average
* The value of markets that correctly predicted the outcome, and the value of markets that incorrectly predicted the outcome
* The correct rate of the individual bettor and the correct rate of the individual contract
* The correct rate of contracts based on confidence (interval from 50% to 100% confidence)
* The correct rate of the bettor based on confidence (from $0 to $1000 worth of confidence)
* The amount of money put in the markets each quarter, and the accuracy of the bettor in each quarter
* The accuracy of the 1000+ bettor in each quarter
* All of that data analysis repeated for each individual subject (Sports, Politics, Science, etc)
